1. What happens if another broker goes down ?

If another borker goes down, the console keep spamming the message : 

[2022-07-27 14:28:22,509] WARN [Consumer clientId=console-consumer, groupId=console-consumer-89319] Connection to node 2 (luca-CREM-WXX9/127.0.1.1:9094) could not be established. Broker may not be available. (org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient)

connection doesn't seem to work anymore

2. What if you have 5 brokers and 2 go down?

A notification says that the connection to the node we killed could not be established.
However messages can still be sent.

3. What if you changed the replication factor for your topic?

For example if we set the replication factor to 5, messages won't be send because it needs to be replicated 5 times so 5 brokers have to be up.
Indeed, replication factor sepcify how many time the message will be replicated in order to provide availability. The more the replication factor the more date will be reliable and available.


For the screenshots I set replication factor to 3 and launched 4 brokers. When I shutdown the Broker 4 messages can still be send since replication factor is 3 and there is still 3 broker up. When I shutdown Broker 3 messages can't pass from producer to consumers anymore which is normal since the replication can't happen anymore with just two brokers.
See the screenshots for more details.
